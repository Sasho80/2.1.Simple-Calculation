01.Problem:Square Area
This code demonstrates how we can calculate the square area by the given length of the side.

02.Problem:Converting Inches into Centimeters
Let's write a program that reads a floating-point number in inches and converts it to centimeters.

03.Problem:Greeting by Name
Let's write a program that asks the user for their name and salutes them with the text "Hello, <name>!"

04.Problem:Concatenating Text and Numbers
Besides for summing up numbers, the operator + is also used for joining pieces of text (concatenation 
of two strings one after another). In programming, joining two pieces of text is called "concatenation". 
Here is how we can concatenate a text with a number by the + operator.

05.Problem: Calculating Trapezoid Area
Let's write a program that inputs the lengths of the two bases of a trapezoid and its height (one 
floating point number per line) and calculates the area of the trapezoid by the standard math formula:
area=(b1+b1)*h/2.0.

06.Problem: Circle Area and Perimeter
Let's write a program that calculates a circle area and perimeter by reading its radius r. Formulas:
• Area = π * r * r
• Perimeter = 2 * π * r
• π ≈ 3.14159265358979323846…

07.Problem: 2D Rectangle Area
A rectangle is given with the coordinates of two of its opposite 
angles. Calculate its area and perimeter (see the screenshot).
In this task, we have to consider that if we subtract the smaller
x from the bigger x, we will obtain the length of the rectangle. 
Identically, if we subtract the smaller y from the bigger y, we 
will obtain the height of the rectangle. What is left is to multiply 
both sides.

08.Problem: Triangle Area
Write a program that reads from the console a side and height of a triangle and calculates its area. 
Use the formula for triangle area: area = a * h / 2. Round the result to 2 digits after the decimal point 
using fixed << setprecision(2),by including the library <iomanip>).
