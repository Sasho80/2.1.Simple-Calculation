01.Problem:Square Area
This code demonstrates how we can calculate the square area by the given length of the side.

02.Problem:Converting Inches into Centimeters
Let's write a program that reads a floating-point number in inches and converts it to centimeters.

03.Problem:Greeting by Name
Let's write a program that asks the user for their name and salutes them with the text "Hello, <name>!"

04.Problem:Concatenating Text and Numbers
Besides for summing up numbers, the operator + is also used for joining pieces of text (concatenation 
of two strings one after another). In programming, joining two pieces of text is called "concatenation". 
Here is how we can concatenate a text with a number by the + operator.

05.Example: Calculating Trapezoid Area
Let's write a program that inputs the lengths of the two bases of a trapezoid and its height (one 
floating point number per line) and calculates the area of the trapezoid by the standard math formula:
area=(b1+b1)*h/2.0.

Example: Circle Area and Perimeter
Let's write a program that calculates a circle area and perimeter by reading its radius r. Formulas:
• Area = π * r * r
• Perimeter = 2 * π * r
• π ≈ 3.14159265358979323846…
